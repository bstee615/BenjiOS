Started Fall 2018

This began as a hobby project as I was to take an Operating Systems class in Spring 2019. My goal is to get a GUI and user programs working and implement some of the mechanisms I am learning about in Operating Systems class.

# Requirements

The tools I'm currently running:

- `binutils-2.32`
- `gcc-9.2.0`
- `xorriso-1.4.6`

Cheers!
