Started Fall 2018

This began as a hobby project as I was to take an Operating Systems class in Spring 2019. My goal is to get a GUI and user programs working and implement some of the mechanisms I am learning about in Operating Systems class.

# Requirements

The tools I'm currently running:

- `binutils-2.32`
- `gcc-9.2.0`
- `xorriso-1.4.6`

Each of these tools must be built from source to target the same architecture. The current target architecture I'm using is `i686-elf-gcc`. Check [here](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler) for boilerplate configurations when building from source.

Following [JamesM's](http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/) tutorial and [Bran's](http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/Docs/intro.htm) tutorial.

Cheers!
